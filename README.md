This session explores how to install and run WSPR on a Raspberry Pi.  We will look at TAPRâ€™s easy solution and how to roll your own including a low pass filter.

We will install WsprryPi on a Pi and examine its output using a TinySA spectrum Analyzer.  We will then install a low pass filter from QRP Labs and examine the improved output.
We will use a NanoVNA Vector Network Analyzer to analyze the effectiveness of the low pass filter.

We will try a TAPR hat for WSPR which includes a low pass fiter, amplifier, pushbutton switch, and LED along with adjustments for our signal.

I will present some samples of using WSPRnet to see how my propagation worked on 20M and 40M.
